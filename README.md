# My-Data-Analysis-Projects

This is my repository where I keep my data analysis projects. My projects include working with tools such as Python, R, SQL and data managing tools such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Power BI and Tableau. 
Competencies which are important and that are covered in my projects include Data Cleaning, Manupulation/Wrangling, Visualization and Story tellig with data. Other operations that are performed are extracting data from soft files such csv/xlsx and transforming that data into a meaningful information using programming languages Python and R.
