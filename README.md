# My-Data-Analysis-Projects

This is my repository where I keep my data analysis projects. My projects include working with tech tools such as Python, R, SQL and data managing tools such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Power BI and Tableau. 

Operations that are covered in my projects include Data Cleaning, Manipulation/Wrangling, Visualization and Story tellig with data. Other operations that are performed are extracting data from soft files such csv/xlsx/json and transforming that data into a meaningful information using programming languages Python and R.

After fully analysing the data, conclusions and recommendations are suggested in the last stages of my project.
